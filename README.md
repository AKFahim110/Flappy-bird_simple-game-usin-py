# Flappy Bird Clone

A simple 2D side-scrolling game built using Python and the `pgzrun` library, inspired by the classic *Flappy Bird* game.

## Game Features

- **Smooth scrolling background**: The background moves slowly, creating a realistic scrolling effect.
- **Random obstacles**: Obstacles (bars) move at random speeds and positions.
- **Score system**: The player earns points as they successfully pass obstacles.
- **Game over conditions**: The game ends if the bird collides with an obstacle or goes out of bounds.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pgzrun` library

You can install the necessary library using the following command:

```bash
pip install pgzero
